                            welcomes you to join our Christ-centered community in Chinhoyi. 
                            We believe in sharing the good news of Jesus Christ, celebrating new beginnings through baptism, 
                            and growing together in faith through worship services, Bible studies, and fellowship.
                            We strive to live by Christ's example, 
                            extending a helping hand to our neighbors and actively serving the Chinhoyi community.

                        <h6>The Doctrine of God:</h6>

                        <p>
                            We believe in one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son (Jesus Christ), 
                            and Holy Spirit (Exodus 20:3, 1 John 5:7).  This triune God is our Creator, Redeemer, and Sustainer.  
                            He is all-powerful, all-knowing, and ever-present, characterized by perfect love, justice, and mercy.

                        <h6>The Doctrine of Man:</h6>

                        <p>
                            We believe God created humans in His image, perfect and sinless (Genesis 1:27).  
                            However, through free will, humanity chose to disobey God, introducing sin and 
                            its consequences into the world (Romans 5:12).  
                            Despite this fall, God desires to restore humanity to fellowship with Him.

                        <h6>The Doctrine of Salvation:</h6>

                        <p>
                            We believe salvation is God's free gift offered to all through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9). 
                            His sacrificial death on the cross provides forgiveness of sins and reconciliation with God (Romans 5:1-11).  
                            Through repentance and acceptance of His grace, we are transformed and empowered to live a new life for Him.
                        </p>

                        <h6>The Doctrine of the Church:</h6>

                        <p>
                            We believe the church is the community of believers united by faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 1:22-23).  
                            This community is called to worship God, proclaim the gospel message, nurture believers, 
                            and serve others (1 Corinthians 12:27-31).  
                            Chikonohono Adventist Church strives to be a vibrant and welcoming expression of this global Christian community.

                        <p>
                            We believe God desires our lives to reflect His character.  
                            The Holy Spirit empowers us to live a life guided by God's law (the Ten Commandments) 
                            and the teachings of Jesus (Matthew 22:37-40).  
                            This includes acts of love, service, and compassion towards others (Galatians 5:22-23).

                            We believe in the literal, visible return of Jesus Christ to Earth (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18).  
                            This second coming signifies the end of evil and the resurrection of the dead (John 5:28-29).  
                            The righteous will inherit eternal life in God's new kingdom, 
                            while the unrepentant will face final judgment (Revelation 20:11-15).
